Verse
1 I can feel my 2fingers slippin' off the 3edge and now I'm 2fallin'
1 Never knew I was 2missin' out on this there's a 3darkness 2calling
1 Feel it eating at the 2edges of my brain 3I hit rock 2bottom
1 See the light 2flicker just to die It's 3time to 2lose my sight
1 2 3 2

Chorus
1 Does anybody 3know I'm here? 4Can anybody 2find me
1 Everyone is 3not as they appear. 4 We're barely 2stitched together seams (seems)
1 To me 3anything 4goes if you don't 1want the world to know
1 Who you 3are. 4You won't get very 1far

Verse
1 When a dream 2lingers fillin' up my 3head I've got a 2problem
1Don't wanna spend time 2livin' just to liveoOnly 3you can 2solve this
1Spend every moment 2tryin' to make a change 3 gotta end my 2turn
1 Shift the blame to 2anyone but me. Only 3I can 1set me free

We are all alone inside our minds
Only we know what that's like
Only we can stand up and fight
For our truth and sight
