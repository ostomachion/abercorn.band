Verse
It's been a 1long 2four months 3 3
And 1everyone's been 2mad at me 3 3
'Cause I'm 1saying all the 2things that I've 3always said 3
But 1now with more 2honesty 3 3
And the 1kids 2know I'm nearby 3 3
But 1sometimes it's 2not enough 3 3
And my 1friends don't 2know 'cause they 3can't understand 3
1Why I 2feel alone 3 3

Chorus
1Mother I still 2tell them about 3life and 3death
How I 1couldn't be there with 2you for your 3very last breath 3
I say that 1actions and 2words don't al3ways connect 3
And 1life isn't 2always fair 3 3
1Sometimes 2I get 3scared 3

Verse
I 1dug up an old 2memory 3 3
Of a 1girl who 2used to dance 3 3
And there's a 1lady standing 2there, she 3starts to sing 3
She 1smiles and 2starts to laugh 3 3
1I won't for2get about that 3 3
But I 1try not to 2think of you 3 3
'Cause I 1cry and I 2don't know why 3 3
And 1dad said 2something very 3interesting 3
He 1said I 2act like 3you 3
So 1maybe I am 2crazy too 3 3
Or 1maybe it was 2never true 3 3

Chorus
//

Bridge
You 1gave me something 2I forgot I 3had 3
Through 1all the tears, the 2fights and all the 3bad 3
And 1Dad he 2misunder3stood 3
How 1emotions can 2still be good 3 3
