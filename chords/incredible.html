Verse
1 Got my head on 2sideways
3 'Cause I don't wanna 4think
1 And its only on the 2bad days
3 That I don't wanna 4speak
1 And the nightmares are 2creepin' in
3 But I can feel your 4warmth
1 Even if the demons 2make it in
3 I know I'm in your 4arms

Chorus
1 You make me feel 2special
3 I can't get 4enough
1 You make me feel in2credible
3 There's nothing quite 4like your love
1 You make me feel 2special
3 You're everything 4I want
1You make me feel in2credible
3 I can't get 4enough of your love

Verse
1 Waking up already 2mad
3But I don't know 4why
1So I try to start a 2screamin' match
3 All I wanna do it 4fight
1 Here comes the 2worst of hurts
3 Slippin' off my 4tongue
1 It's my burden, my 2biggest curse
3 I've struggled since 4I was young
