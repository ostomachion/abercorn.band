Verse
1I'm a survivor I adapt to change
2Call me a liar, you'll see me rage
1I've been forgiven for all my sins
2But if you can't say the same then I can't let you in
1Used to be nicer, used to see me smile
2I was none the wiser, now it's been a while
1Got drink in my veins, got smoke in my veins
2Cause when I'm feeling overwhelmed I just have to numb the pain
