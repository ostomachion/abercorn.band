Verse
1You sing the same note, 2I just want to have hope
3We can still be 4friends 
But 1you don't want to trust me 'cause 2I want to believe
3Life can start again 4
I 3thought I learned my lesson once be2fore  
But it 1turns out that I don't know a 4thing
Now I'm 3back at home sitting on the 2floor
Tryna 1come up with the words that I should 4sing

Chorus
I've 1been through the rabbit hole, 2took that potion so 
3I could shrink to your 4size
I 1walked through a closing door, 2turned 'round to see that you're
3still on the other 4side
The other 1side Woah-2oh,
woah-3oh 4

Verse
1You have to hold on, 2I'm trying to move on 
Re3gret was killing 4me
1I know life hurt you, but 2I wear the same truth
And 3happiness isn't 4free
The 3darkness it has it's own re2ward
You can 1hide yourself from all the kinds of 4pain
But to be 3honest I was getting kind of 2bored
Tryna 2act like I don't dance in the 4rain

Chorus

Interlude

Bridge
I 3didn't think that I would leave a2lone
'Cause I 1thought that I had found one of my 4own
So this 3really went and took me by sur2prise
Yeah, I 1thought that we would be each other's 4light

Chorus

The other 1side of 2life, 
I am 3waiting for 4you to come to 
1me. Oh 2oh, oh 3oh 4
