Verse
1 Was it your confidence 2 that shattered my defense
I 3thought I could handle 2you
1 But then your kiss hit my lips. 2 Nothing else was making sense
And 3I was played a 2fool

Chorus
Then 1I fell for 2you, like you 3wanted me to 3Yeah, yeah, yeah
1I fell for 2you. 3 You left me beaten and 1bruised
2Word on my lips, well 3I let it slip. Now I 1see you steppin' 2back
3Heart on my sleeve, 1made it easy to 2crack 3I fell for you

Verse
1 Was it your arrogance 2 or my ignorance 
That 3made me want 2you?
1But then your hand brushed my hand. 2My heart raced again,
3Use me I'm your 2tool
