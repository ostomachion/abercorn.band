Chorus
1She's gonna go out to Virginia.
2Don'tcha know, girl, how much I'll miss ya.
1She's got a boy out in the Navy.
2She don't see me. She don't see me.

Verse
1Standin' over here let me whisper in your ear.
2I don't wanna see you go, don't wanna see you disappear.
1Let me tell you straight, don't need you for your pretty face.
2It's the mind that you own, it's the girl that I know.
1If you're getting out from this lame-ass town,
2Just know you're the only one who gets me when I'm down.
1So let's run away like we did that one day.
2We can go for a year. We can go without fear.

Chorus

Verse
1If it's been too long since the last time we talked,
2I'm telling you right now I want what you got.
1You're the kind of girl got me begging on my knees.
2Got me higher than the clouds, higher than trees.
1You bring out my best, really put me to the test.
2So show me the world, show me life and the rest.
1I'm not saying love, 'cause I don't need your heart.
2You know I'm a mess, but with you I am art.

Chorus

1You can't stay, and I won't go,
