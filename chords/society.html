Verse
I 1woke up late 2today. There's 3so much on my 4brain.
I'm as 1empty as the 2cup that I 3drink my poisons 4from.
And 1checking every2day cause 3I'm still losing 4weight
Said I 1went to the 2gym but I 3couldn't eat 4again,

Chorus
This is the 1world, this is my 2pain
I'm 3trying to 4pretend
I'm not in my 1head, where everything's 2safe
I'm 3trying to fit 4in to
Soc1ie2ty, 3you're killing 4me 
Soc1ie2ty 3won't let me 4be

Verse
I 1stayed out late last 2night. I think I'm 3looking for a 4fight.
With a 1stranger I can 2hurt. My 3weapons are my 4words.
But I 1didn't like the 2scene with all my 3insecuri4ty
People I 1know, people I 2don't. Oh 3god I need to 4smoke
