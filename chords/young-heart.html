Verse
You never got to see my hair curled
You never saw my tattoo
Now I'm standing in the mirror
Thinking, "Black just doesn't do."
God, I wish I wasn't here now.
I'd rather live a lie
It was already over
I didn't think you would die
I didn't think you would die

Chorus
Oh, a 2young 3heart shouldn't 4know this kind of 1pain
Where 2sadness rules but 3life still goes 4on 4
2I get up at 3sunrise to 4be with you a1gain
2As crazy as it is 3I'm still a4live 4

Interlude

Verse
I went by our favorite place
And I walked by the laundromat
Where we talked about our life and things
We drank our cofee as we sat
You wanted me to write a song
About our summer and our time
Well this is all I have left inside
I didn't want you to die
I didn't want you to die
