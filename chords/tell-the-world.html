Verse
1I've got a new style
1I've got a new vibe
1I've got my own sound
2And I'm to loud
1To be drowned out
1I've got a new day
1With the same face
1And a new chance
2To chase down my plans
1I'm gonna make my stand

Chorus
'Cause 2I got a lot to say
And 1I'm gonna make a change
I don't know 3how, and I don't know 2when
Gotta figure it 3out 'cause it's 2happenin'
Tell the world I'm 1comin'

Verse
1There's a new crowd
1Hangin' downtown
1With a strong pull
2On my worn out soul
1And I can't take this slow
1With a microphone
1I'll put on a show
1Up on a stage
2I'll fly away
1Every single day
