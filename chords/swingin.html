Verse
1 I'm walking a 2tightrope
Balancing, 3I hope  I don't fall 4off
If I do, will the 1rope catch me round my neck 2
I'll fall to my death 3 as the noose goes 4taught

Refrain
And you'll see me 1swingin' 2
In the 3breeze like a warnin' sign 4
To the people who 1sing out, 2
"She be3lieved that she could fly 4 so high"

Verse
1 So why do I risk 2 it
I need the a3drenaline in my 4veins
Some people are 1stupid, they never 2learn
But I think I've 3earned not to be in4sane

Refrain
So if you see me 1swingin' 2
Well I don't 3care if I 4die
'Cause the people who 1sing out 2
Well, they 3know how I had to 4try
So if you see me 1swingin' 2
In the 3breeze, I'm a warnin' 4sign
To the people who 1sing out, 2
"We be3lieve that we can 4fly so high"
