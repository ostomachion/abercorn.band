Verse
1I don't like the stars but I wear them for 2you
1You're permanent on my heart just like a tat2too
1Wear the battle scars cause it means I'm 2true
1Take all my parts intertwined with 2you

Chorus
You were the 1start, the 2beginning
of the 3things I 4never knew
Now I'm 1forced to live a 2life
4without you 4
You were the 1finish, you were the 2ending
of the 3chapter, 4"Die Too".
When you 1said that 2we were
4through 4

Verse
1We planned our night all the way 2through
1I still feel the excitement that we 2knew
1We burned to bright, to fast to 2prove
1A love for life I wanted with 2you

Bridge
3I don't want 4another day
1fending off 2the words you say
3cause they're lies, 4and I don't know why
1you wanna make eme 4cry
3I've been feeling 4out of place
1looking for your 4familiar face
3All the moments that we had 4 I wanna take  them back
