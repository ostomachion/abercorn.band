Never thought it would come to this
Never thought we'd be taking sides
Never thought I'd lead an army
Against the white knight

And 4when your bring me 1down
I 4start to 3drown

Chorus
Been under your mind control,
I'm breaking, I'm breaking
Been under your mind control
I'm breaking out from
Truth in your white lies
You had me hypnotized by
Truth in your white lies
I've been blindsided by the 
Truth in your white lies
You had me hypnotized by
Truth in your white lies
Your white lies
