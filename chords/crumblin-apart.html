Chorus
1 Everything is 2crumblin' apart
3 While I'm standing on top 4
1I've been ig2noring the signs
3 That we're coming un4done

Verse
1Realized just the other day
That 2you don't really care what I have to say
3In my heart or in my mind
4You never really have the time
1 To give me what I need
2Put away the better side of me
3 So I can please 
Your 4narcissistic tendencies
1 You don't care how I feel
You 2never did, you're never real
The 3conversations that we have
Re4volve around why you're so sad
1 Funny now how at the time
2 You come to me, ask why
The 3bad things happen, start a fight
4Don't know how to admit that you're not right
1In your head or in you heart
2Everything you do tears me apart
3It's not fair but I don't care
4Maybe it's time that I start

Chorus 2
//
1Everything is 2crumblin' apart
3 While I'm standing on 4top
1 I've been ig2noring the signs
3'Cause I don't want it to 4stop

Verse
1Two AM I could call you up
'Cause 2I know that you're still awake
You 3hear my voice, you'll just hang up
'Cause 4I'm the one you love to hate
1 I see you drivin' by
Your 2blank stare, your head held high
But 3you still wear my sweater
Even 4when you say you never
1 Walk away when things get hard
2 I don't know who you are
3 You're the one holding all the cards
It's 4not a game with real ARs
1 I wish I could have you back
I'm 2not afraid to admit to that
But 3not when I'm under your control
I 4need to live life on my own
1 I'm human just like you
2Thinking, breathing, shitting too
But 3I am not your goddamn fool
Won't 4live my life the way you choose

1If I came 2back to you
3 It would be 4suicide
1I know that 2loving you, yeah
3 Loving you is a lie 4
1If I came 2back to you
3 It would be 4suicide
1I know that 2loving you, yeah
3 Loving you is a 4lie
