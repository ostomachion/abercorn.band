Verse
When 1I was twelve years 2old I didn't 3know that the world could 4be so cold
1I just 2wanted to have 3hope 3
1When you're young 2you're so reckless. 3You fill you're lungs 4when you're breathless
1Cause the world hasn't 2knocked you to your 3knees 3
1People said I 2shouldn't speak my mind 3That was when I knew it was 4my time to shine
1So I told them 2exaclty what I 3thought, 3 I said

Chorus
1I'm a precious stone, 2 I'm gonna give the 3world Something it don't 4know that it's missing
1Glimmerin, 2shimmering, full of 3hope 4 Are you listening?
1I'm a precious 2stone, I'm gonna give the 3world Something it don't 4know that it's missing
1Glimmerin, 2shimmering full of 3hope 4 Are you listening?

Verse
When 1I turned eigh2teen I thought I 3knew just about 4everything
1Then at twenty 2three my mama 3died 3
1Ever since, 2I've been haunted 3by my past, 4all the nonsense
1I can't seem to 2get out of my 3head 3
1When I reached my 2darkest point Swear to 3god I heard my 4mama's voice
1Singing out the 2words from when I was 3young 3 She said

Chorus 2
1You're a precious 2stone, I'm gonna give the 3world something it don't 4know that it's missing
1Glimmerin, 2shimmering, full of 3hope 4Are you listening?
1You're a precious 2stone, I'm gonna give the 3world something it don't 4know that it's missing
1Glimmerin, 2shimmering full of 3hope 4Are you listening?

Verse
1The other day 2I turned twenty six 3So many things I still 4wanna fix
1People say I 2can't change the world 3 I'm just one girl
1This is for the 2ones who got their heart broke 3Beaten down and 4didn't let the world know
1This is for the 2ones who've been told that 3They're too young to 4understand

Outro
When 1I was twelve years 2old I didn't 3know that the world would 4be so cold
But 1now that I 2do you give me 3hope
