1I'm looking for all the 2rules to break
Cause I'm 3here to take back what's 2mine

You don't 4want to leave the 3ground

You gotta 1try, try again, don't give 2up 'cause in the end
it's gonna 3work out, give it a little ti4me
You gotta 1try, try again, don't give 2up 'cause in the end
it's gonna 3work out, give it a little ti4me
Give it 1time 2 3 2

You don't 4want to leave the 3ground
